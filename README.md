# Working Async Remote

Hi! Welcome to the world remote work and asynchronous communication. It's great to have you.

The fact that you're reading this (and I'm typing this) whenever we want is a great demonstration of how remote async work...works!

## How did we get here?

Before COVID, the world was already largely relying on async communication (see the 60% stat below). What's really new, is the push to remote work. Many, many people are experiencing remote work for the first time.

> In a study conducted by Condeco Software, 41% of global businesses surveyed say they already offer some degree of remote working, while 60% provide flextime opportunities that allow employees to choose when to start and end their workday.

## Remote Async means two things!

You might have heard of *async* communication, or *remote* work but what is **async remote**? Well, it's a combination of both qualities. 

You already have experience with *async* communication, but you might not have worked remotely before. Here's a simple chart showing what both experiences look like:

|  | Sync | Async |
|---|---|---|
| Office | Meetings | Emails, Documents |
| Remote | Video Calls, Chat | Email, Documents |

### Location

- **office** - Allows you to "bump" into someone, chat verbally, etc.
- **remote** - Intentional interaction, reach out, text based.

### Communication

For starters, here's what "synchronous" and "asyncronous" mean in regards to collaboration:

- **sync** - Two or more people exchange information in real-time. In most workplaces communication happens that way and people expect real-time responses. 
- **async** - The exchange of data between two or more parties without the requirement for all the recipients to respond immediately.

### Comparisons

Let's take a look at some more comparisons in practice:

| Sync Office | Async Remote |
|---|---|
| Office Space | Work From Home | 
| Meeting Rooms | Video Calls | 
| Sitting near a team member | Team based Chat |
| Watercooler Conversation | Topic Based Chat |
| Tapping someone on the shoulder | Direct Messaging |
